# Logistic map based encryption and decryption
This is a Python implementation of cryptographic technique based on logistic map first introduced by Baptisa in 1999.
1. Logistic map based Symmetric Cryptography.pdf : Details out cryptographic technique based on logistic map and related work. This file can be used as starting point to understand the work.
2. baptisa.pdf,baptisa2.pdf : Papers published by Baptisa explaining the crptographic technique.
3. crypt.py : Implementation of the technique without shadowing (shadowing can be understood from 2)
